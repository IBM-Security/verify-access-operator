# This workflow will be triggered whenever a push occurs on specific
# branches (e.g. when a pull request is merged).  The action will build and
# publish the verify access operator.  The docker images will be
# published to docker hub for 'master' builds, and a private
# artifactory repository for 'development' builds.
